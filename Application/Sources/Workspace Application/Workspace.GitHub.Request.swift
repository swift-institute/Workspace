    /// The same reason ``Workspace/Inventory/Transport`` does it: the Institute
    /// has no public HTTP client package, and Foundation's `URLSession` is
    /// barred. This is a Swift adapter over the `Process` product already in
    /// this manifest, not shell automation — the two calls it makes are fixed,
    /// and nothing it produces is hand-maintained.
    ///
    /// ## Why the credential is carried twice
    ///
    /// `GH_TOKEN` alone does not work here, and the failure is not obvious:
    /// `gh` sends it as `Authorization: token <value>`, and GitHub answers an
    /// application assertion presented under that scheme with *"A JSON web
    /// token could not be decoded"* — a message that reads like a malformed
    /// JWT rather than a wrong scheme, and sends the reader looking at their
    /// signing code. Application assertions are accepted only as `Bearer`, so
    /// the scheme is set explicitly.
    ///
    /// `GH_TOKEN` is still set, because `gh api` refuses to run at all without
    /// a credential it can resolve; the explicit header then decides what
    /// actually goes on the wire. The child also gets a *complete* environment
    /// snapshot, because `gh` needs `HOME` and `PATH` to function.
    ///
    /// The consequence is that the assertion — never the installation token —
    /// appears in the child's `argv` for the length of one call. It is a
    /// nine-minute credential that can do nothing but ask for the tokens this
    /// command was invoked to mint, which is the narrower exposure of the two
    /// available; the minted token itself never leaves this process except on
    /// stdout and in the mode-600 cache.
